    "A radiance field is a function that describes how light transport occurs through a 3D volume. It describes the direction of light rays moving through every $x=(x, y, z)$ coordinate in space and in every direction $d$, described either as $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ angles or a unit vector. Collectively they form a 5D feature space that describes light transport in a 3D scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NeRF, inspired by this representation, attempts to approximate a function that maps from this space into a 4D space consisting of color $c=(R,G,B)$ and a density $\\sigma$, which you can think of as the likelihood that the light ray at this 5D coordinate space is terminated (e.g. by occlusion). The standard NeRF is thus a function of the form $F_\\theta : (x,d) \\rightarrow (c,\\sigma)$."
